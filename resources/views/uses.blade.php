                    I'm joining the web developer trend of having a /uses page! If you're unfamiliar, a /uses page
                    is basically a list of tech ranging from software to hardware that a developer might want to use.
                    This was mostly done for tech influencers and tech enthusiasts with a following. I know what you're
                    thinking... but Roberto you don't have a following and calling you an influencer is highly inaccurate.
                    I'm not really looking to be an influencer per se, but I'm trying to get my voice out there. Which is
                    why my portfolio has a blog to begin with. To share ideas and be more active in a community that has
                    done so much for my life. Most importantly though, this page exists for the simple reason that I think
                    it's fun! Tech often changes and so my tool kit is constantly updating. Hopefully you find this helpful.
