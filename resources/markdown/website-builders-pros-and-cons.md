# Website Builders: Are they right for you?

Website builders have been around for a long time in one form or another. Whether it's something like Squarespace or
Wix, or even a CMS like WordPress, there have been options for building websites without a dedicated Web Development
team. They can be very useful for businesses of various sizes, as they empower you to create your own websites. However,
there are considerations to be taken when choosing if a website builder fits your needs. Before starting, I do want to
talk about the elephant in the room: I am a web developer and I would prefer that all business use a professional web
developer. However, I am personal experience around these website builders and I hope you consider the advice I'm giving
despite my bias. In addition, this isn't an indictment of website builders, more of a clarification of pros and cons.

## What are website builders?

Typically, website builders are online tools that allows users to create websites without having to hire a developer.
This often takes the form of a drag and drop menu where the user can drop in an image and write the necessary text.
Builders also come with templates and themes that can be customized to suit the needs of the user. These themes are
often built by web designers that work for the company or in some cases independent parties. More often then not, if a
user wants to build a simple website then the default settings and functionality should be enough. However, there often
is a plugin or extension market that bundles helpful functionality. WordPress for example has plugins for integrating
things like newsletters to ecommerce.

## Pros of website builders

1. They are easy to use: They are designed to have a low barrier to entry and can get as complex as you need them to be.
2. They are easy to customize: They can be customized to suit the needs of the user.
3. Opinionated: Because you are not a developer the builder makes tech decisions for you so you can focus on your
   business.
4. Low cost: They often have a subscription or are free to use.
5. Developer Support: There are often developers who specialize in these tools. WordPress for example has a large
   community of web developers.
6. Independence: You're in control of everything. You don't have to rely on a professional. You need to update it's all
   in your hands.

## Cons of website builders

### Ease of use

By design, they have to have a low barrier to entry. This makes them easy to use. However, they take time to build and
maintain. While you're working on your business and all that entails, you have to learn how to use the tool and how to
extend functionality and add new features. As a result, you may find that you need to spend more time working on your
website or learning new features and maintaining security on your site, rather than working on your actual business.
These tools are purposefully built so that all the decisions a developer would have to make about what technology to use
is taken out of your hands and made for you. This is to make things easier for users to start using the system, but as
your business grows your business needs will change, and you will be the one responsible for maintaining your site. 

This may not be a drawback for you if you're excellent with time management. It's a downside for most, that are starting
a new business. Eventually you come to a conclusion that you have to either hire a developer or have someone maintain 
the site and be the subject-matter expert. 

### Customization

As mentioned in the previous section, they can be customized to suit the needs of the user.
