# Neovim Falling in and out of Love

If there is something you need to know about me, it's that I have a long love affair with hollywood hackers. I'm not
talking about stuff like Mr. Robot (though I really like that show), I'm talking about movies like Hackers. Nonsensical
techno babble, a visual barrage of terminal windows and hitting the keys on a keyboard as if they are typing the all of
Moby Dick in one minute. Because of this I gained a love for keyboard shortcuts. I have tried to learn any tool so that
any complicated action is reduced to a simple keystroke. If possible, I would eliminate the use of a mouse altogether
from my workflow.

I've only been a Web Developer for 6 years now and with that comes my history with text editors or IDEs. I've used a lot
of them throughout my time. I started with Sublime Text, then Atom, VS Code and then PHPStorm. Now out of all of those
PHPStorm had to be my favorite. Mainly because it had everything built in. Why use a separate terminal, FTP portal,
database manager, and a plethora of other tools. While I was perfectly happy here, I kept clashing with co-workers who
used VS Code, and sometimes I would work through a client virtual machine that had limited results, so I had to use a
more lightweight editor. Now here's where I might lose some of you. I don't really like VS Code. Don't get me wrong, I 
don't care if you personally use VSCode, but I find some of its features lacking compared to PHPStorm. I did spend 
some time and got a configuration that I liked and occasionally have to use. But I just couldn't get the workflow as 
elegant as I had it back in PHPStorm. 

## Enter Neovim

As tech influencers such as The Primeagen and TJ Devries, started getting popular I really started to get fascinated. 
Here was an editor that combined the lightweight nature of VSCode, unparalleled customization, the most awesome keyboard
shortcuts, all of which built into a terminal to give me the ultimate 90's hacker experience. I. Was. Sold. I took the 
first steps, and started learning vim motions using IdeaVim. It took me the better part of a month to really get into 
the groove of it, but after a while I was hooked.
